Superb eCommerce is made for online shops, stores, and boutiques. WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) are deeply integrated into the theme. It works with every block, widget, and page builder available. There's a beautiful and minimal blog, so if you're a writer as well, then you can start blogging easily. You can sell software or other digital products and physical products, such as clothing, furniture, or beauty products. It works with every plugin, such as Contact Form 7, Elementor, and MetaSlider. It's responsive and SEO optimized (Search Engine Optimization), which means it has a good page speed, clean code and loads fast. Superb eCommerce is fully GDPR compliant, all fonts are local to avoid compliance issues. You can use WooCommerce and the blog to create a drop shipping affiliate store with Amazon or promote products through different affiliate programs. It's a true multi purpose theme that works for any niche, whether interior, fashion or retail.
